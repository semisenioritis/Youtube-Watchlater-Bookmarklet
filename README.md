# Youtube-Watchlater-Bookmarklet
This is a js snippet that is to be used as a bookmarklet to save youtube videos to my watchlater and go through them later at my leisure



## Usage:
To use this code as a bookmarklet, remove all line breaks and comments in the code and add uncomment the top comment at the start of the code. After this step, all code along with "javascript:" should be on a single line. Also don't forget to replace the dummy google appscript endpoints with your own endpoint.
