# Youtube-Watchlater-Bookmarklet
This is a js snippet that is to be used as a pair of bookmarklets to save youtube videos to my watchlater and go through them later at my leisure

One of my main issues with youtube's watch later system is that even though it's easy to add videos to your watchlater playlist, it's quite difficult and unnatural to get back to them when you need them. This just leaves me with 50-odd different tabs that all have interesting videos I want to watch but just don't have the time to do right now.

This pair of bookmarklets allow you to quickly add the current youtube video as an entry in a google sheet (emulating a database) and then select a random video at one click from your saved videos. 

## Usage:
To use this code as a bookmarklet, remove all line breaks and comments in the code and add uncomment the top comment at the start of the code. After this step, all code along with "javascript:" should be on a single line. Also don't forget to replace the dummy google appscript endpoints with your own endpoint.
